## Inspiration
Our Team believes that "Talent is distributed equally across the communities but the opportunities aren't". The inspiration behind this project is to help the communities by building a platform to address this issue. The platform tries to provide the resources and proper career guidance to the aspirants from under represented communities to excel in their careers from professionals in their respective industries.
## What it does

It provides a platform for tech industry professionals who are willing to give back to the communities to register and mentor students. 
Similarly the students or candidates who need mentors can register in the website.

Students can go through various mentor profiles and send a application to mentors. 
Mentors can go through the various applications and choose to mentor some students according to their choice.

## How we built it
 Following is the Tech stack:  
 Front end: ReactJS   
 Backend : NodeJS  
 Database: MongoDB  

## Challenges we ran into
All the team members agreeing upon a unified solution to address the challenges of the communities. 
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're happy that we were able to build a product that solves the problem and successfully accomplishes the ideas that we wish to convey. It's a great experience that we were able to bring up such a website with required features under 3 days. 
## What we learned

## What's next for EdifyingForce
We want to extend the additional tools required like the Job Postings, Video conferencing tools and all other features which can ease the interaction between the mentor and students.
