## Inspiration
Our Team believes that "Talent is distributed equally across the communities but the opportunities aren't". The inspiration behind this project is to help the communities by building a platform to address this issue. The platform tries to provide the resources and proper career guidance to the aspirants from under represented communities to excel in their careers from professionals in their respective industries.
## What it does

 It provides a platform for tech industry professionals who are willing to give back to the communities to register and mentor students. 
 Similarly the students or candidates who need mentors can register in the website.

 Students can go through various mentor profiles and send a application to mentors. 
 Mentors can go through the various applications and choose to mentor some students according to their choice.
 Mentors or Organisations can host Webinars or Events to train candidates in the respective technologies
